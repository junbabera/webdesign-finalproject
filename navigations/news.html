  <h2>Are kids really safe from Covid? Study says only a fraction of infected children show symptoms</h2>
  <br>

  <br><br>
  <p>The research, published in the journal CMAJ, analysed results for 2,463 children in Alberta, Canada, who were tested during the first wave of the pandemic -- March to September -- for COVID-19 infection. "The concern from a public health perspective is that there is probably a lot of COVID-19 circulating in the community that people don't even realise," said Finlay McAlister, a co-author of the study from the University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry in Canada. "When we see reports of 1,200 new cases per day in the province of Alberta, that's likely just the tip of the iceberg -- there are likely many people who don't know they have the disease and are potentially spreading it," he said. Of the 2,463 children, 1,987 had a positive test result for COVID-19 and 476 had a negative result, and of those who tested positive, 714 -- about 36 per cent --reported being asymptomatic. Due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease in up to one-third of children, McAlister said closing schools for a longer period over Christmas was the right decision. "As far as we know, kids are less likely to spread disease than adults, but the risk is not zero. Presumably asymptomatic spreaders are less contagious than the person sitting nearby who is sneezing all over you, but we don't know that for sure," he added. The researchers also found that cough, runny nose and sore throat were three of the most common symptoms among children with COVID-19 infection -- showing up in 25, 19 and 16 per cent of cases respectively. However, they said these symptoms were slightly more common among those with negative COVID-19 test results, and therefore not predictive of a positive test. "Of course, kids are at risk of contracting many different viruses, so the COVID-specific symptoms are actually more things like loss of taste and smell, headache, fever, and nausea and vomiting, not runny nose, a cough and sore throat," McAlister said. "Some people with COVID feel well and don't realise they have it so they socialise with friends and unintentionally spread the virus, and I think that's the big issue," he added.

        <h2>Common test for admission to central universities from 2021</h2>
        <br>

        <p>NEW DELHI: In a move intended to end the tyranny of cut-off marks based on Class XII Board exams for college admissions, the government has set up a seven-member committee to recommend modalities for “high quality aptitude test” for admission to undergraduate programmes of central universities that will come into effect from the 2021-22 academic session. The computer-based common entrance exam, to be conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), will be mandatory for admission to all central universities. “This is going to be implemented from the 2021-22 session for the central universities.” Amit Khare, secretary, higher education, said. There will be a general test as well as subject-specific tests. UGC chairperson professor D P Singh said the committee is expected to submit its recommendations within a month. Officials of the ministry of education (MoE) said it would give an opportunity to universities to enrol aspirants with “aptitude” for a course and also eliminate the need to appear in multiple admission and entrance exams. The minimum eligibility to be set for the test would also ensure that more candidates are eligible for admission. For example, at present any unreserved candidate with even 90% in the ‘best of four’ Class XII Board papers cannot secure a seat in the commerce stream in most of Delhi University colleges. But even a candidate with 60% will be able to sit for the common entrance exam and possibly qualify for admissions. Moreover, difference in evaluation scheme of various Boards has been a concern for UG admissions. Typically higher scoring science stream students edge out aspirants in social science subjects on the basis of Class XII board marks. According to MoE sources, all aspirants will have to appear for the common aptitude test (comprising verbal and quantitative ability and logical reasoning), followed by subject-specific tests. The National Education Policy, 2020 envisaged that NTA “will work to offer a high-quality common aptitude test, as well as specialised common subject exams in the sciences, humanities, languages, arts, and vocational subjects, at least twice every year. These exams shall test conceptual understanding... Students will be able to choose the subjects for taking the test, and each university will be able to see each student’s individual subject portfolio and admit students into their programmes base on individual interests and talents”. While the policy speaks of offering the exam a maximum of two times in a year, Khare said it would be conducted only once for the 2021-22 session. The seven-member committee will be chaired by Professor R P Tiwari, vice-chancellor of Central University of Punjab, Bathinda. The other members include VCs of DU, Central University of South Bihar, Central University of Mizoram and Banaras Hindu University, along with director general of NTA and joint secretary (central universities) of MoE. As per UGC, as of June 2020, there are 54 central universities.</p>
