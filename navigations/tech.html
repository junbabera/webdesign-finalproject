    <h2>IPO-bound Flipkart rejigs board to add CEO Krishnamurthy, 3 others</h2>
    <p>By Samidha Sharma & Alnoor Peermohamed, ETtechLast Updated: Dec 25, 2020, 12:13 PM IST</p>

    <br>
    <p>Mumbai | Bengaluru: Flipkart has initiated a major board reshuffle, bringing in four new members, including CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy, as the Walmart-owned e-commerce marketplace prepares to hit the stock markets next year amid a rush of initial public offerings (IPOs) in the technology sector globally.
      In the reshuffle, announced to employees through a company-wide email on Thursday, new members — HDFC CEO Keki Mistry, Walmart’s global chief technology officer Suresh Kumar and Walmart’s executive vice president for international strategy and development Leigh Hopkins, find a place along with Krishnamurthy.
      Steuart Walton, the grandson of Walmart founder Sam Walton; Dirk Van den Berghe, EVP, Walmart Asia; Rajesh Magow, cofounder, MakeMyTrip; and independent director Rohit Bhagat are the outgoing members.
      ET has seen a copy of the email.
      “I wanted to let you know that this New Year will see some changes to our board as a number of our current directors will be stepping down after steering us through the first two years following Walmart’s investment,” Krishnamurthy said in the email.
      Flipkart declined to comment on ET’s specific query over the change in board composition till press time on Thursday.
      The US retail behemoth will continue to retain three seats on the board even after the exercise, with Walmart International president and chief executive Judith McKenna continuing to function as board chairperson. Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal and former Tiger Global executive Lee Fixel will also hold on to their seats.
      “I am happy to share with you that at the board meeting earlier this month, your board was highly appreciative of all our efforts this year, expressed pride in the progress we have made and looked forward to seeing the next chapter of our development as we move towards 2021...,” Krishnamurthy added.
      ET reported on December 14 that Berghe was retiring from Walmart and would subsequently step down from the Flipkart board as well. In June last year, ET first reported about Flipkart’s plan for a public listing in an overseas market.
      The changes to Flipkart’s board come soon after Walmart spun off PhonePe, to help the digital payments arm raise external capital. PhonePe’s board of directors will consist of co-founders Sameer Nigam and Rahul Chari, along with Binny Bansal and Rohit Bhagat.</p>

      PUNE: Software engineering services Infogain today said it has acquired Absolutdata, a San Francisco based artificial intelligence and advanced analytics company. This is the third acquisition by Infogain in the last 14 months. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
      “Infogain’s acquisition of Absolutdata completes our three-pronged
      acquisitions strategy to help customers' increasing demand for adopting digital platforms by employing strategy and experience, cloud transformation, and advanced analytics and AI services,” said Infogain’s CEO Sunil Bhatia. About 400 Absolutdata employees in the US and India will move to Infogain following the acquisition.
      The acquisition gives the company access to Absolutdata’s NAVIK AI platform and access to new verticals, said Ayan Mukerji, COO, Infogain. “NAVIK AI represents our first commercially available SaaS platform and is part of our broader strategy of helping our clients leverage digital platforms combined with our transformational service offerings. We aim to double our analytics customer base over the next two years and are confident that this acquisition will help us significantly toward achieving  that goal.”
      This will help strengthen Infogain’s presence in verticals like consumer goods, telecom and pharma.
      “Companies across the globe are increasingly looking towards a combination of Technology and AI/Analytics to drive scalable, sustained & profitable business growth. The COVID -19 pandemic has further accelerated digital transformation across organizations.," AbsolutData’s CEO Anil Kaul.
      This follows Infogain’s acquisitions of Houston-based Silicus Technologies and Seattle-based Revel Consulting. Data, analytics and artificial intelligence are strategic focus areas for Infogain and will account for 15% of its revenue post-acquisition, said the company. About 75-80% of the company’s business currently come from North America. It has identified three key areas of focus, Cloud, design experience and data analytics and AI.
